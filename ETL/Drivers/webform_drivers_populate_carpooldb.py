# Pseudocode:

# See if the driver is already registered.

# if so, associate the new opportunity for the driver to drive, with the existing driver. 

# if not, add the driver to the list. 

# Initiate the validation of the user's email (or phone, via Trello?)

# Determine if the driver is OK to submit further to the matching engine. 
#( if so, then the matching engine will pick up the records from here.)
